Title: Cat9 Delivers!
Body: My 10 year old recently joined a travel team and now able to use a USSSA bat. Have heard some good things about the Cat9 alloy so decided to buy one and my son loves it. Swings fast and balanced! Loud alloy pop when he hits! Feels lighter than a 18oz. Maybe b/c of the way they designed the bat. All I know is that he loves it and that makes me happy!

Title: 14 y/o Loves It!
Body: My son was swinging a 32/29 Goods and purchased this in a 33/30. He said they weren¡¯t much different in the feeling, but he was going to save the 33/30 for slower pitchers and next season. So far, he¡¯s dropped some great hits!

Title: Disappointed
Body: We bought this expensive bat after encountering firsthand the reliability issues with Demarini. After having this bat for less than two weeks the end cap broke off of it and I had to send it back to Rawlings. My son is in the middle of his high school baseball season and is having to borrow someone else¡¯s bat on the team.

Title: Broke after less than a month
Body: My son just got this bat on January 1st and has only gotten to use it a handful of times. He liked the pop and seemed to really like the bat. Then last night, during hitting practice with his team, the knob on the end broke off. He is pretty upset about it. He has a few teammates that also just bought DiMarini bats and now they are on edge about it happening to them. This is not the quality you expect of a $400 bat. His $200 Easton bat has held up and lasted so much better than this did. So very disappointed and frustrated. Never thought we would have to make a warranty claim after just 3 weeks and right the middle of preseason practices.

Rate:1
Title: The bat broke after 3 uses
Body: I bought this a month ago.  The bat can¡¯t take the speed of a fast ball it seemed. The bat bent right where the two piece meets. My dissatisfaction comes from that I could not even return it to the store and have to go through warranty.  So I am without a bat and the spring baseball season is coming to an end.

Title: Bat snapped in half after six uses, two weeks after purchase
Body: For the price of the bat and quality they claim, this shouldn't happen really ever. Bat was used for four little league games in total and snapped in half. Purchased on April 16th, snapped on May 1st - two whole weeks of use. 12-year old is not on PED's, the bat sucks.
